Linked lists are comprised of a series of nodes\
each n ode hold two pieces of data

NODE
1      2
value  address of next node

each node points to or references the next node on the list
first node is the head
last  is the tail

Lookup
by value: 0(n)
By index  0(n)

Insert
At the end : 0(1)
Beginning : 0(1)
middle: 0(n)


DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ARRAYS AND LINKED LISTS
Dynamic arrays grow 50%-100%
Linked lists don't waste memory

I you know roughly how many items you have to store before hand, use a list

Searching by index
Arrays 0(1)
LL 0(n)

Looking up by value
Arrays 0(n)
LL 0(n)

Insert Beginning/end/middle
Array 0(n)/0(n)/0(n)
LL 0(1)/0(1)/0(n)

Delete Beginning/middle/end
Array 0(n)/0(n)/0(n)
LL 0(1)/0(n)/0(n)
