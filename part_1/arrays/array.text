elements in a array ge stored sequentially in memory

looking up an array by index is 0(1)

if you need to store a list of items and find by index, arrays are the optimal data structure

Deletion is a 0(n) operation

if you have to remove or add a lot of items in an array, they dont perform well - use linked lists
